            <h2>1. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT</h2>
            <h4>1.1. Information you give us</h4>
            <p>
              In order for you to use our Services and other features of our
              Site, we will ask you for some of your personal data (e.g. contact
              information, name, etc.). The amount and type of information that
              we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who
              purchase Services from us are asked to provide additional
              information including, as necessary, the personal and financial
              information required to process transactions. In each case, we
              collect such information only insofar as is necessary or
              appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us.
              You can always refuse to supply personal data; however, doing so
              may prevent you from receiving our Services or engaging in other
              activities on the Site. In no event will we ever request sensitive
              personal data (e.g. health information, religious preferences,
              etc.) from you, and we expressly request that you not provide any
              such sensitive personal data to us.
            </p>

            <h4>1.2. Web service log</h4>
            <p>
              As is true of most websites, we gather certain information
              automatically through your use of the Site. This information may
              include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet
              service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, the files viewed
              on the Site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system,
              date/time stamp, and clickstream data to analyze trends in the
              aggregate and administer the site. We use analytical software to
              help us understand this information. This software sends
              information to its licensor. Other sites and companies may also
              use this software. As a result, the licensor may collect
              information that, when aggregated by them, allows them to identify
              you individually. We have no responsibility for this collection
              and use.
            </p>

            <h4>1.3. Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              We use cookies and similar technologies to analyze trends,
              administer the Site, track users` movements around the Site, and
              gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You
              can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
              Ads appearing on our Site may be delivered to you by advertising
              partners who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
              recognize your computer each time they send you an online
              advertisement to compile information about you or others who use
              your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other
              things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be
              of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers our use of
              cookies and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
              However, data tracking files used by us may also be used by these
              advertisers and, when combined with other information held by
              them, be used to identify you personally. For more information on
              third party cookies and instructions on how to opt-out of those
              cookies set by members of the National Advertising Initiative,

            <h2>6. GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION</h2>
            <p>
              6.1. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (
              <a target='_blank' href='https://www.eugdpr.org/'>
                https://www.eugdpr.org/
              </a>
              ) is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. Though it
              was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), it imposes
              obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or
              collect data related to people in the EU. The regulation was put
              into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR will levy harsh fines
              against those who violate its privacy and security standards, with
              penalties reaching into the tens of millions of euros.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.2. In relation to the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
              and other applicable legal acts Master Click Ltd will process the
              data provided in this online application and any other data which
              you subsequently give to us in any manner in order to fulfill the

              otherwise for legitimate business reasons; For internal assessment
              and analysis (e.g. automated profiling, market and product
              analysis); If we are under a duty to disclose or share your data
              to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation; or to protect
