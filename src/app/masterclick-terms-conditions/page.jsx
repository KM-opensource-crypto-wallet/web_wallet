            <h4>THE WALLET</h4>
            <p>
              the Company enables You to create one or more digital
              multi-signature, non-custodial, cryptocurrency wallets for certain
              supported cryptocurrencies and digital assets (the “Wallet”) that
              lets You store, send, request and receive supported
              cryptocurrencies and digital assets. All transactions requested
              and/or made through the Wallet are irreversible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Wallet is not and shall not be deemed as an account where the
              Company or other third parties serve as custodians of Your
              cryptocurrencies or digital assets. The Wallet is only for use
              with Bitcoin (BTC), or Ether (ETH), or Binance Coin (BNB) and with
              any other cryptocurrencies or digital assets that the Company may
              explicitly decide to support in the future at its sole discretion.
              The Company has no obligation to support any cryptocurrencies or
              digital assets (including but not limited to any forkcoins,
              altcoins, airdrops or any other cryptocurrencies or digital
              assets, however named). The Company takes no responsibility or
              liability in connection with any attempt to use Your Wallet for
              cryptocurrencies or digital assets other than the supported
              cryptocurrencies and digital assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              By accessing and/or using the Services, You acknowledge and agree
              that the Company can’t guarantee the confirmation of any
              transaction on any blockchain network. The Company has no control
              over any blockchain network.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the Wallet has undergone beta testing and continues to be
              improved through feedback from its users, the Company cannot
              guarantee that there will be no errors and/or bugs in the
              functioning of the Wallet.
            </p>
            <p>
              the Company provides You with the means to secure Your Wallet and
              help ensure You, and only You, are able to access and transact
              through Your Wallet, including mnemonics, personal identification
              numbers (PINs) and private key pairs. The Company does not store
              or have access to Your mnemonics, PINs or private key pairs. You
              shall be solely responsible for safekeeping Your mnemonics, PINs,
              private key pairs, and any other means of authentication You use
              to access Your Wallet. If You lose such means of authentication,
              the Company has no way to recover them for You. As a consequence
              of such loss, You may permanently lose access to any
              cryptocurrencies or digital assets You have stored in Your Wallet.
            </p>
            <h2>3. IMPORTANT WARNINGS ABOUT THE WALLET</h2>
            <p>
              {`The Company’s Wallet allows You to initiate and manage cryptoasset
                transactions on blockchains and similar networks compatible with
                the Wallet ('compatible networks'). Dealing or trading in
                cryptoassets is inherently risky, as the prices of cryptoassets
                can change rapidly. The Company cannot guarantee that the value of
                any cryptoassets that You purchase will not fall. The Company does
                not provide any investment advice. For the avoidance of doubt, it
                is Your obligation to understand the specific risks of the
                cryptoassets in which You participate.`}
            </p>
            <h4>a. Keys management</h4>
            <p>
              {`The wallet that executes Your cryptoasset transactions is only
                accessible through a combination of a particular public key, which
                may be disseminated widely and is used by the market to identify
                the owner of a cryptoasset on a pseudo-anonymous basis, and a
                private key, which is known only to the owner, and is the only
                thing that can be used to transact with cryptoassets held in a
                wallet. Together, the private key and public key form Your unique
                identifier on the relevant blockchain network (Your "Public and
                Private Key Pair"). Your Public and Private Key Pair will be
                created when You download and set up the Wallet.`}
            </p>
            <p>
              {`You will need this Public and Private Key Pair to use Your wallet
                and to carry out transactions and manage Your cryptoassets
                (whether through the Wallet or not). Your Public and Private Key
                Pair will be paired with and stored on the Device on which You
                download and install the Wallet (Your 'Device'). You will
                therefore need to keep Your Device safe and secure in accordance
                with best practices recommended by the provider of Your operating
                system, such as setting up a 'strong' PIN to prevent unauthorised
                access and ensuring that You keep Your software up to date.`}
            </p>
            <p>
              {`You are responsible for ensuring that Your Device is secure. Do
                not use the Wallet on a Device that has been 'jailbroken',
                'cracked', 'rooted' or otherwise had restrictions in the software
                removed, as this may compromise the security of Your Public and
                Private Key Pair.`}
            </p>
            <p>
              {`Each Public and Private Key Pair is unique and can only be
                recovered using a specific 'recovery code' (also known as a
                'Seed', “Seed Phrase”, or 'Mnemonic'). This code is made up of a
                series of 12 or 24 random words which will be given to You when
                You open and set up the Wallet.`}
            </p>
            <p>
              You should never give Your Public and Private Key Pair or Your
              recovery code to any other person, as this will enable them to
              execute transactions using Your wallet. The Company will never ask
              You to share the private key of Your Public and Private Key Pair
              or Your recovery code. The Company will not be responsible for any
              losses You might suffer from disclosing Your Public and Private
              Key Pair or recovery code to another person.
            </p>
            <p>
              If You lose Your Device, or if Your Device is stolen, You will
              lose access to Your Public and Private Key Pair and will need to
              recover it using Your unique recovery code. The Company does not
              store Your recovery code – You must write it down and store it
              somewhere safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              {`Do not store Your recovery code on Your Device. If You lose Your
                Device and/or Your recovery code, You will not be able to recover
                Your Public and Private Key Pair and You will lose access to Your
                wallet and cryptoassets. The Company will not be responsible for
                any losses You may suffer if You lose Your Device or recovery
                code. Please note that, if You delete the Wallet from Your Device,
                or if You disable the security features on Your Device, Your
                wallet will no longer be paired with Your Device and Your Public
                and Private Key Pair will be removed from Your Device's storage.
                To recover Your Public and Private Key Pair, You will need to use
                Your recovery code. The Company will not be responsible for any
                losses You might suffer as a result of losing Your Public and
                Private Key Pair if You delete the Wallet. Completion of
                transactions that You initiate through the Wallet also depends on
                the availability and operation of the relevant compatible network
                You interact with using the Wallet. Errors or forks in the
                compatible network may cause transactions that You initiate
                through the Wallet to fail. This may mean that the transaction You
                were originally intending to perform will no longer be available.
                Unfortunately, due to the decentralised nature of these networks
                and blockchain technology, there is no one single point of
                failure, and so neither the Company nor any particular party will
                be responsible to You for errors or any losses that You suffer as
                a result.`}
            </p>
            <h4>b. Network fees</h4>
            <p>
              {`In order to execute transactions on certain compatible networks,
                You will need to pay network fees. For instance, if You execute
                transactions on the Ethereum network, this is known as 'gas'. The
                network fees are set by the operators of the relevant compatible
                network and can fluctuate depending on the level of congestion on
                that compatible network. Transactions might fail if the network
                fee for that transaction is set too low.`}
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company will set the network fees for the transactions that
              You initiate through Master Click wallet to account for current
              and foreseeable congestion levels and will notify You if the
              relevant compatible network is busy. However, there may be
              unexpected spikes in the usage of that network that can cause the
              network fees to increase suddenly above the price that The Company
              set for Your transactions. The Company will notify You if a
              transaction fails as a result of the network fees for that
              transaction being set too low. If the transaction You are trying
              to perform is on Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, The Company will
              do our best to identify this and replay the transaction with a
              higher network fee. However, The Company will not otherwise be
              responsible to You for any losses that You suffer as a result of
              any transaction through the Wallet failing as a result of the
              network fees being set too low.
            </p>
            <h2>4. ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER TERRORIST FINANCING</h2>
            <p>
              Decentralized services, such as the Services, are currently
              excluded by law from any identification duty. However, the legal
              environment is still under development. Regulatory authorities are
              carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated with
              cryptocurrencies in the world. The Company’s business model may
              change because of new legal, regulatory and compliance
              requirements from any applicable laws in any jurisdiction, even
              with retroactive effect, especially for KYC (Know Your Customer)
              and Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws and regulations. In such a
              case the Company is committed to applying the AML legislation
              providing You with safe, compliant, and reputable service. This
              includes monitoring of suspicious transactions and mandatory
              reporting to the supervisory authorities. In addition, pursuant to
              the AML rules, the Company shall keep certain information and
              documentation on file for a period of five years after the
              termination of the relevant business relationship or from the
              completion of the relevant transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              In such a case the Company will ask, verify, and record
              information identifying any person accessing and/or using one or
              both Services according to the applicable legal requirements.
              Therefore, to access and/or use of certain Services You may have
              to follow a KYC (Know Your Customer) process in order to verify
              Your identity. In such a case the Company will ask You to verify
              Your Identity, where You have to provide true, current and
              complete information about Yourself. If You are a representative
              of a corporation, governmental organization or other legal entity,
              You must prove that You have the right, power and authority to
              enter into these Terms on behalf of the corporation, governmental
              organization or other legal entity and to legally bind it to these
              Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the Company may require You to provide documentation
              to verify the information You have submitted to the Company
              including, without limitation, an identification card or a
              passport, a utility bill, a bank statement or any document proving
              Your identity issued by a governmental body.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, Your access and/or use of the Services is subject to
              international economic sanctions requirements. By accessing and/or
              using the Services, You agree that You will comply with those
              requirements. In particular, You shall not access and/or use the
              Services if: (1) You are in, under the control of, or a national
              or resident of a country subject to United States embargo or UN
              sanctions (a “Sanctioned Country“), or if You are a person on the
              sanctions/embargoes list published by the Office of Financial
              Intelligence Directorate (FID) (a “Sanctioned Person“); or (2) You
              intend to supply any cryptocurrencies or digital assets to a
              Sanctioned Country (or a national or resident of a Sanctioned
              Country) or Sanctioned Person.

            <h2>5. SERVICE LIMITATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS</h2>
            <p>
              the Company will make reasonable efforts to keep the Services
              operational. However, certain technical difficulties or
              maintenance may, from time to time, result in temporary
              interruptions. To the extent permissible under applicable law, the
              Company reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to
              modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and
              features of the Services, with or without notice, without
              liability to You, for any interruption, modification, or
              discontinuation of the Services or any function or feature
              thereof.

            <p>
              By accessing and/or using the Services, You acknowledge that

              of liquidity, market depth, and trading dynamics. There is no
              guarantee against losses for accessing and/or using the Services.
              By accessing and/or using the Services, You represent and warrant
              that You are not entering into transactions that are above Your
              financial abilities. Also, cryptocurrencies and digital assets are
              not suitable for people without the relevant knowledge and/or
              experience. By accessing and/or using the Services, You further
              represent and guarantee that You are aware of the risks related to
